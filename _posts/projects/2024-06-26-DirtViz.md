<p>DirtViz is a hardware and software ecosystem tailored for outdoor sensor networks. Our hardware component, the Soil Power Sensor, collects data from sensor measurements in the field. Our data ingestion and visualization backend, DirtViz, receives data from the hardware nodes and presents it in an easy-to-use web interface that allows users to dynamically generate plots, or download data for offline processing. We have deployed a number of sensors measuring qualities like soil moisture, temperature, current and voltage in outdoors settings
