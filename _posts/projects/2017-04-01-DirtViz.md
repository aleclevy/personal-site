<p>DirtViz is a project to visualize data collected from sensors deployed in sensor networks. We have deployed a number of sensors measuring qualities like soil moisture, temperature, current and voltage in outdoor settings. The project goal is to create a fully-fledged dataviz tool tailored to the types of data collected from embedded systems sensor networks.
